# Firetoad and Waterfrog

Created by me as a class project for CSY1079 (Programming 2D Computer Games) at the University of Northampton

Game inspired by Fireboy and Watergirl (https://www.friv.com/z/games/fireboyandwatergirlforest/game.html)

Notes:
  - The TileMap class is based on the TileMap class from the SFML tutorial page "Designing your own entities with vertex arrays" (https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/graphics-vertex-array.php). I       modified it to fit my code.
  - The source code and the "Assets" folder containing the assets I designed for the game can be found in the "CPP-SFMLTemplate" folder.
  - This project was built using the SFML library within Visual Studio 2022.
